Viking Metal Death Glögg
========================

- 4oz Orange Peel
- 52 Whole Cloves
- 40 Cardamom Pods
- 4oz Cinnamon Sticks
- Cheesecloth and twine
- 1.5L Cabernet
- 1.5L Port
- 5oz Brandy
- 1lb Sugar

###Prepare the Spices

Peel the oranges in long strips avoiding as much of the pith as possible. Smash the cardamom pods with the flat of a knife to crack them open. Put the orange peel, cardamom pods and seeds, cloves, and cinnamon in a tinfoil tray.

###Smoke the Spices

I use a Weber Smokey Mountain, but any smoker will do. Fill the smoker’s water reservoir with a bag of ice and top off with cold water. Light about a quarter-chimney’s worth of charcoal and add  4-5 fist-sized chunks of wood. I used apple wood, but oak or another light flavor will do. Place the foil spice tray on the rack just above the water reservoir, close all the bottom vents and let smoke for 3-4 hours keeping the lid temperature as close to 100º as possible (lower is better). Once the orange peels have turned a nice deep orange and started to curl, but before they shrivel up and lose all their yummy oils remove the tray from the smoker and dump it out onto a sheet of cheesecloth. Wrap the spices in the cloth and tie with kitchen twine to make a little spice packet.

###Mull the Wine

Combine the wines in a large pot, cover and bring to a gentle boil. Turn the stove down to a simmer and add the spice packet. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes.

###Make the syrup

While the wine is mulling, combine the sugar and brandy in a small pot and cook on low until the sugar has dissolved.

###Finish and Serve

Once the wine has finished mulling remove the spice packet letting any extra wine drip back into the pot and stir in the syrup. Simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and dump the pot into a slow-cooker or transfer to the empty wine bottles to save it for later. Serve hot and garnish with chopped almonds and raisins.
